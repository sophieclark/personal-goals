In here you can list steps to accomplish your goals.

Here's an example:

If my goal was to create a dog-themed SVG animation a day, I could list out different animation ideas:

1. Dog jumping over hoop into pool
2. Dog floating on the moon
3. Dog in glasses, reading book
etc..

If my goal was to film more videocasts, this could be used for topics

Nov. 2: Mario Kart over the ages
Nov. 9: Why Princess Peach lied
