Online Courses
==============

Here is a list of all the courses I am currently taking or have completed. I'll try and give a rating for each. Feel free to suggest any.


## Courses:
- [ ] The Complete iOS9 and Xcode 7 Guide - Aaron Cains, Udemy 
- [x] The Complete iOS8 and Swift Course - Rob Percival, Udemy, 4/5 good for complete beginners but doesn't get as advanced as I'd hoped
